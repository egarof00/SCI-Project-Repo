# Project: Sustainability Android Application (Work in progress)

# This code is used in Unity to create an application where users must earn in-game credits by completing energy saving tasks
# These credits are used to pay for food to keep their virtual pet alive

# Working on implementing the timing of the virtual pet becoming "hungry" and implementation of some sort of leaderboard for multiple users
